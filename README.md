# LitAngular

This is an expiremental repo for seeing if there is a way to substitute Angular's default "proprietary" templating engine with something more JavaScript based, e.g. (tagged) template literals.  Using something like [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/).

## Setup

Run `yarn install`
